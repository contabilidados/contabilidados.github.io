Hi! My name is Kléber, and I am a R-Lady from Brazil 🇧🇷 💜.

I'm a [tidyverse instructor certified by RStudio](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/milz+beatriz/), and I teach R at [Curso-R](https://curso-r.com/).

I have been writing about R in my blog since 2019. I'm mostly active in the Brazilian R community, co-organizing communities and events, such as: [R-Ladies São Paulo](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSaoPaulo), [Latin-R](https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf), and [satRday São Paulo](https://twitter.com/satRdaySP).

I'm a PhD Candidate at the [University of São Paulo](http://www.iee.usp.br/), in Environmental Sciences. My research is about **transparency of information** in the **management of water resources** that are used to supply the Macrometropolis of Sao Paulo.
